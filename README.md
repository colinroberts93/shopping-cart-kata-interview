# shopping-cart-kata-interview

This is a application built for the keoghs interview process.

I have used an API that I created before the challenge which is from a website called mockaroo, I only have a free version therefore only so many requests are allowed per day. If the items dont appear when the page has been loaded then it could be that we have gone over the limit for the day. (just let me know and i can swap the api link)

I have also included logic that creates a discount should so many items be in the users basket:
5 items 25% off
10 items 50% off

I simply ran out of time to implement the logic to make the button disable/working depending on items in the basket although I believe the logic would be similar to the discount code logic, rather than times the price it would check to see how many items are in the basket and display the correct button accordingly.
